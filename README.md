Description

This project implements a Storage Device Management System using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python. It models different types of storage devices such as Hard Disk Drive (HDD), Flash Drive, Solid State Drive (SSD), and Compact Disk (CD), each of which inherits from an abstract class StorageDevice. The system allows the user to perform basic operations such as saving files, reading files, and formatting the storage devices.


Features:

Save file: Saves a file to the storage device (checks if thereâ€™s enough space).

Read file: Simulates reading a file from the storage device.

Format device: Resets the storage device to its initial empty state.

Each storage type has its own specific behavior, and the storage capacity for each device can vary, for example, HDD may have up to 500GB, Flash Drive can be 64GB, SSD can be 256GB, and Compact Disk can be up to 0.7GB.


How to Run the Program

Prerequisites:

Prerequisites:

Ensure that you have Python 3.x installed on your system.

Install a code editor/IDE like Visual Studio Code (VS Code) or any other editor that supports Python.

Make sure you have a Python compiler configured in your editor to directly run Python files.



Steps to Run:

1. Clone or Download the repository containing the program files.

2. Open Visual Studio Code (VS Code) or your preferred IDE.

3. Open the folder containing the downloaded project files in your IDE.

4. Open the file storage_device_management.py.

5. In VS Code, ensure that the Python extension is installed and the Python interpreter is selected.

6. Run the program by pressing F5 (or running the following command in the terminal):

python storage_device_management.py

7. The program will create instances of storage devices (HDD, Flash Drive, SSD, and Compact Disk) and will allow you to save files, read files, and format them.
